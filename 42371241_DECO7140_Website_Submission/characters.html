        <h1>Lief</h1>
        <img src="images/lief3.jpg" alt="Lief" class="character"/>
        <p class="companion_text"> Lief was born just after the Shadow Lord took over Deltora.
          He grew up on the streets of Del City, breaking curfew and evading the Grey Guards.
          When Lief turned sixteen, his father told him the story of his friendship with King Endon, and
          gave him the Belt of Deltora. Lief then set out on a quest he would never have dreamed
          possible, armed with a magic cloak sewn by his mother, and a fine sword crafted by his
          father.</p>

        <h1>Jasmine</h1>
        <img src="images/jasmine.jpg" alt="Jasmine" id="jasmine"/>
        <p class="companion_text">As an orphan, Jasmine was stranded in the Forests of
          Silence at age 7 when her parents were taken by Grey Guards. Jasmine is used to
          living by her wits, and she has a very strong connection to trees and animals.
          Her constant companions are Kree, a raven, and Filli, a small, furred creature.
          Jasmine joined Barda and Lief on their quest when they came to the Forests of
           Silence to find the first gem.</p>

        <h1>Barda</h1>
        <img src="images/barda3.jpg" alt="Barda" class="character"/>
        <p class="companion_text">The son of Jarred and Endon's nursemaid Min, Barda was a
           Palace Guard when the Shadow Lord's evil plans began to hatch. He escaped the
           Palace, and found safety disguised as a beggar, living outside Jarred's home.
           Throughout Lief's childhood, Barda secretly acted as his protector, saving Lief
           from capture by the Grey Guards again and again. Barda would have preferred to
           search for the gems on his own, but as the two companions venture on their quest,
           he quickly comes to appreciate the aid and companionship of young Lief.</p>
